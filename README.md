# Fluidized bed

The purpose of this project is to computationally investigate the effects of vertical vibration on fluidization behavior of Geldart A particles of coal and a few biomass mixtures, resulting in a better understanding of the fluidization velocity, pressure drop and bed expansion at different mass ratios.
